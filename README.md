# Assignment
Create a one page application following the LO-FIs given in this assignment.

We suggest to use create-react-app typescript for your setup.

Juniors can do either the backend or frontend test. 
Intermediate engineers and above are also expected to complete backend test to persist the data.

## LO-FI
Remember these are LO-FI and should only be treated as such. 
You are asked to write a simple ordering program that will collect order information
and when submitted, it will display list of ordered items on the main screen.

## Spec
These are the only functional requirements for your implementation:

### Navigation
- Clicking on the menu will roll down and display individual menu items
  - Home
  - New Item

Selecting `Home` item will navigate to the landing page. The landing page
will display list of ordered items (Full Name, Order Description, Quantity and ability to delete an item)

Selecting 'New Item' will navigate to `\new` page where a new order item can be added.

### Inputs
- First Name
  - Must not be longer than 20 characters
- Last Name
  - Must be entered, no longer than 20 characters
- Order description
  - Must be entered, no longer than 100 characters
- Quantity
  - Must be a number between 1 and 20

### Submit
- You cannot submit until input fields are valid
- After submitting the item, it will navigate back to the landing page where list of orders will be displayed

## Data Storage

If the assignment is front-end only, a simple state management or 
Redux store (preferable) to store data is sufficient. 

## What is valued
- Tests
- Typescript
- Clean Code
- State Management
- Design (Responsive)
- Accessibility

## Duration
Use roughly 3 hours on this assignment. You are only expected to do work on 
this assignment that matches the skill level of the role you are applying for, but you are welcome to do as much as you like. 
You are not expected to do everything in this assignment because of the short time duration of the assignment,
but rather demonstrate familiarity with the technologies.
